# ECPS Verification Tutorial

This repository supports the **Specification and Verification of Embedded and Cyber-Physical Systems (ECPS)** tutorial using [ESBMC](https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc).

## ðŸ”§ Setup

Build ESBMC from source. See [BUILDING](https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc).

You can also download the binary. See [RELEASES](https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc/releases)


## ðŸ§ª Topics Covered

- Formal Specification with Temporal Logic (LTL)
- Safety & Liveness Verification using ESBMC
- ECPS Modeling Exercises
- LLM-Generated Code + Formal Verification

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `examples/`: Basic verification examples
- `exercises/`: Hands-on ECPS modeling tasks
- `ai_generated/`: Code generated using LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)
- `slides/`: Presentation slides for the tutorial

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

- Linux Ubuntu
- GCC/Clang
- [ESBMC](https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc)
- [ltl2ba](https://github.com/esbmc/libltl2ba)

## ðŸš€ Run an Example

```bash
esbmc examples/assert_example.c
````
